### **Tech Stack**:
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **ETL Framework**: Hazelcast Jet (for lightweight ETL and stream processing)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Data Modeling & Storage**: MySQL (relational data modeling and storage)
- **Data Governance & Security**: Spring Security (for role-based access control)
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus + Grafana (for pipeline health, metrics)
- **Version Control & CI/CD**: GitHub + GitLab (CI/CD integration)
- **Cloud-based Solution** (Optional): Can be moved to cloud (AWS/GCP) later, but for local, we'll keep everything in a containerized environment (e.g., Docker).

### **Project Outline:**

#### **1. Data Warehouse Design and Setup**
   - **Goal**: Create a data warehouse structure in MySQL to store transformed data.
   - **Tools**: MySQL (with tables for raw and processed data).
   - **Process**:
     - Set up **MySQL** as the data warehouse.
     - Design a **schema** to hold incoming data (raw data) and transformed data.
     - Create **ETL tables** for staging, raw data, and processed data.
   - **Outcome**: This covers **data warehouse infrastructure** and **data modeling**.

---

#### **2. Data Pipeline (ETL Process) with Hazelcast Jet**
   - **Goal**: Build an **ETL pipeline** that ingests, transforms, and loads data from raw data to structured data.
   - **Tools**: Hazelcast Jet (for processing and transformation), MySQL (for storage).
   - **Process**:
     - Use **Hazelcast Jet** to implement the ETL pipeline.
     - Ingest data from **CSV/JSON/API** into the raw data table in MySQL.
     - Implement **transformations** (filtering, aggregation, enrichment) on the raw data.
     - Load the transformed data into the processed data table in MySQL.
   - **Outcome**: Covers **ETL process**, **data integration**, and **optimizing data pipelines**.

---

#### **3. Data Governance, Quality, and Security**
   - **Goal**: Implement **data governance** and **security best practices** within the ETL pipeline and database.
   - **Tools**: Spring Security (for access control), MySQL (for data encryption).
   - **Process**:
     - Implement **role-based access control** using **Spring Security** to restrict access to sensitive data.
     - Set up **data encryption** in MySQL for sensitive fields.
     - Ensure that data integrity and quality checks are performed during the transformation (e.g., ensure no duplicates, apply validation rules).
   - **Outcome**: Covers **data governance**, **quality**, and **security best practices**.

---

#### **4. Data Modeling and Storage for Analytics**
   - **Goal**: Optimize data storage in MySQL to support future analytics.
   - **Tools**: MySQL (with normalized data models, indexing for faster query execution).
   - **Process**:
     - Normalize and index data in MySQL to support efficient querying for **analytics and business intelligence**.
     - Implement **dimensional data models** (fact and dimension tables) if required.
   - **Outcome**: Covers **data modeling** and **data storage** for analytics.

---

#### **5. Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting**
   - **Goal**: Set up **monitoring**, **logging**, and **alerting** mechanisms for your ETL pipeline.
   - **Tools**: Prometheus (metrics), Grafana (visualization), Hazelcast Jet (metrics integration).
   - **Process**:
     - Use **Prometheus** to collect **metrics** about the ETL pipeline (e.g., processing speed, errors).
     - Set up **Grafana** dashboards to visualize these metrics in real-time.
     - Implement **alerting** rules to notify you of any ETL failures or performance issues.
   - **Outcome**: Covers **monitoring**, **logging**, and **alerting mechanisms**.

---

#### **6. Collaboration and Scalable Data Solutions**
   - **Goal**: Ensure the pipeline scales and integrates with other business processes.
   - **Tools**: Hazelcast Jet, Spring Boot (for API integration).
   - **Process**:
     - Use **Hazelcast Jet** to handle large data volumes efficiently (streaming data).
     - Implement an **API layer** (using **Spring Boot**) to enable other teams to access the processed data.
   - **Outcome**: Covers **scalable data solutions** and collaboration with **cross-functional teams**.

---

#### **7. Cloud Deployment (Optional)**
   - **Goal**: Containerize your application and deploy to cloud (e.g., AWS, GCP) for future scalability.
   - **Tools**: Docker (containerization), AWS/GCP (cloud services).
   - **Process**:
     - **Containerize** the ETL pipeline, MySQL, and any necessary tools using **Docker**.
     - Deploy it to the **cloud** for easier scaling and integration into larger business systems.
   - **Outcome**: This is optional but aligns with the **cloud-based solutions** requirement.
