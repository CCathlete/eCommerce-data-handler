Great plan! Here’s how we’ll proceed:  

---

### **1️⃣ Run the ETL Pipeline Manually**  
✅ **Steps to test manually:**  
- Upload a raw data JSON file to MinIO.  
- Call the ETL use case from the application layer (e.g., via a REST API or a test script).  
- Check if the transformed data appears in the MySQL database.  
- Debug any issues that arise.  

🔹 **How will you trigger the ETL use case manually?**  
- REST API?  
- Command-line script?  
- Direct method call?  

---

### **2️⃣ Implement Event-Driven ETL**  
✅ **How MinIO Event Notifications Work:**  
- MinIO can send events (e.g., `PUT` for new files) to an endpoint (HTTP, Kafka, NATS, etc.).  
- Your application listens for these events and triggers the ETL pipeline.  

🔹 **Steps:**  
1. **Enable MinIO notifications** for new files.  
2. **Create an event listener** in your Spring Boot app.  
3. **Trigger ETL automatically** when new raw data is uploaded.  

❓ **Which event mechanism do you prefer?**  
- **Webhook (HTTP POST from MinIO to your app)** – Simple to set up.  
- **Kafka/NATS** – Good if you expect high event throughput.

### **3️⃣ Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana**  
✅ **Key Differences:**  
| **Tool**       | **Purpose**  |  
|--------------|-------------|  
| **Prometheus** | Collects & stores time-series metrics. |  
| **Grafana**   | Visualizes Prometheus data with dashboards. |  

🔹 **Steps:**  
1. **Expose metrics in your app** (e.g., number of ETL runs, errors, duration).  
2. **Set up Prometheus** to scrape metrics from your app.  
3. **Configure Grafana** to visualize metrics & set alerts.

### **Next Step:**  
Let’s start by running the ETL manually. How do you want to trigger it—API, CLI, or method call? 🚀
