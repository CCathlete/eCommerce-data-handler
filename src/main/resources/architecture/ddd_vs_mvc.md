Absolutely, let's slow down and break it down further. It’s great that you want to make sure you fully understand the flow. 

Let’s first highlight what each layer **does** in the context of **DDD** and the typical **MVC** interaction:

### 1. **Presentation Layer** (MVC: **View** & **Controller**)
   - **Role**: Handles user input, displays data to the user, and updates the UI. It’s responsible for the user-facing side of the application.
   - **In DDD**: The **Presentation Layer** consists of the parts of the application that directly interact with the user. This can be web pages, mobile app screens, etc.
   - **Controllers in this layer**: Act as intermediaries that take user input, validate it, and pass it to the appropriate service in the **Application Layer**. 

   Think of it as **"receiving and displaying data"** to the user.

### 2. **Application Layer** (MVC: **Controller** Logic + Orchestrator)
   - **Role**: Manages use cases, orchestration, and application workflows. It doesn't have deep business logic but coordinates interactions between the **Domain Layer** and **Presentation Layer**.
   - **In DDD**: The **Application Layer** is like the middleman. It holds **services** that coordinate actions and communicate with the **Domain Layer**.
   - **DTOs** (Data Transfer Objects) are used here: They help format data in a way that is easy to pass between layers. 

   Think of this layer as **"handling business operations"** based on user requests. It says, "What should be done with the data," but doesn’t do the core work itself.

### 3. **Domain Layer** (MVC: **Model**)
   - **Role**: Holds your **business logic** and domain-specific rules. This is where you model your core entities, aggregates, value objects, and domain services.
   - **In DDD**: The **Domain Layer** is the heart of your business logic. It’s responsible for data integrity, enforcing rules, and containing all the logic that drives your business.
   - **Entities** in this layer define your core business objects, while **Domain Services** might provide operations that don’t fit neatly into a single entity.

   Think of this as **"where the rules of the business live."**

### 4. **Shared Layer** (Common functionality)
   - **Role**: Contains shared resources, such as utilities, helpers, or cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security, etc.).
   - **In DDD**: Things like logging, validation, or even some shared data models might sit here. This layer doesn't contain business-specific logic; it contains components that all other layers can use.
   - **DTOs** can also be shared in this layer if they need to be reused across multiple parts of the app.

   Think of it as **"supporting functionality"** that helps all layers work together.

### Connection Between **MVC** and **DDD**:
1. **In MVC**:
   - **Models**: Represents data and business logic, which in **DDD** would fall under **Entities** or **Aggregates** in the **Domain Layer**.
   - **View**: The part that shows the data to the user.
   - **Controller**: The part that takes input and coordinates how to respond to the user request (acts as an intermediary).

2. **In DDD**:
   - The **Presentation Layer** (like MVC’s **View**) is responsible for showing the data and receiving input.
   - The **Application Layer** (like MVC’s **Controller**) takes user input, runs the use cases, and interacts with the **Domain Layer** to process data.
   - The **Domain Layer** holds the business rules and logic.
   - The **Shared Layer** provides common services like logging, error handling, etc.

### What Happens in a Request Cycle (DDD in Action):
1. **User Input**: The user interacts with the **View** (UI), such as submitting a form or clicking a button.
2. **Controller (in Presentation Layer)**: The controller receives this input and passes it to the **Application Layer**.
3. **Application Service (Application Layer)**: The service orchestrates the necessary operations (e.g., calling domain methods, handling use cases) and might use **DTOs** to transfer the data.
4. **Domain Logic (Domain Layer)**: The domain services, aggregates, or entities do the heavy lifting (e.g., business validation, database persistence).
5. **Return Data**: The **Application Layer** sends back the data, which may be mapped to **DTOs** for presentation.
6. **View (Presentation Layer)**: The **View** updates and shows the user the results.

---

This is the **big picture** of how the layers interact. 

To summarize:
- **In MVC**: The controller mediates user input, the model contains the business logic, and the view displays it.
- **In DDD**: The application layer handles user input and orchestrates logic, but the domain layer contains the actual business rules and data models. The presentation layer is responsible for displaying the data, and the shared layer provides common tools.

Does this distinction make more sense now? Feel free to ask more questions!
